### What is Satyr Farm?

SatyrFarm is a complete farming system for roleplay or just for fun in Opensimulator regions. It contains farm plants, trees, storage, processing machines as well as multiple breedable animals

### Is it in Second Life, too?

SatyrFarm is only available in opensim. It makes heavy use of the OSSL functions that are not available in SL. In addition, it is licensed for non-commercial use only, so it is unlikely to appear in SL. 

### Where can I Get It?
You can get the current up-to-date farm package from the OpenSimWorld Region in Metropolis Grid: https://opensimworld.com/hop/74730-OpenSimWorld. The package contains the complete farm as well as some documentation and extra tools. 

### How do i Set up the basics?
Easy! When you get a copy of SatyrFarm, then you can rez the <b>Satyr Farm Latest 50x50 Platform</b> and it has all the basics ready. Make sure you rez the item in a large open space, as it contains a lot of stuff.  The package also contains the SF Animal Rezzer box, which is used to rez new animals for your farm. As a general rule, we suggest that you start growing some crops before growing multiple animals, otherwise your animals might get really hungry! You should read the manual inside the box for more information on the items ...it can sometimes be confusing! :)

### My animals are spinning in place
If an  animal seems to be spinning in place, it is because you have moved it manually. Click "Stop"  to  have it start wandering again.
