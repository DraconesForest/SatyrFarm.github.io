### What is Satyr Farm?

SatyrFarm is a complete farming system for roleplay or just for fun in Opensimulator regions. It contains farm plants, trees, storage, processing machines as well as multiple breedable animals

### Is it in Second Life, too?

SatyrFarm is only available in opensim. It makes heavy use of the OSSL functions that are not available in SL. In addition, it is licensed for non-commercial use only, so it is unlikely to appear in SL. 

### Where can I Get It?
You can get the current up-to-date farm package from the OpenSimWorld Region in Metropolis Grid: https://opensimworld.com/hop/74730-OpenSimWorld. The package contains the complete farm as well as some documentation and extra tools. 

### How do i Set up the basics?
Easy! When you get a copy of SatyrFarm, then you can rez the <b>Satyr Farm Platforms</b> which have all the basics ready. Make sure you rez it in a large empty space, as it contains a lot of stuff.  The package contains the SF Animal Rezzer box, which is used to rez new animals for your farm. As a general rule, we suggest that you start growing some crops before growing many animals, otherwise your animals might get really hungry! You should read the <a href="/quickstart">quickstart guide</a> for your first steps.

### My animals are spinning in place
If an  animal seems to be spinning in place, it is because you have moved it manually. Click "Stop"  to  have it start wandering again.
