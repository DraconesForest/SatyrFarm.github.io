---

We are now able to sit back and let others doour Smurf for Smurf! I mean smurf for smurf!

We now have a NPC Smurf that you can see in action  OpenSimWorld region, I havent personally seen it yet, but i've been told it is a very amusing thing, go check it out! The NPC is part of the farm package now.

NOTE : IT ONLY WORKS FOR package version 2018.08.28 (Inworld Release 8/28/18) and later


But.... Down to business :

This month has brought many new things including : 

- A Mine
- Power Controller
- Electric Car and Charging Station
- Eating HUD
- And Several other things!


I am asking that if someone has a custom object they made for use with their farm, they send me a copy of it to put in our Farm Cooperative Region
