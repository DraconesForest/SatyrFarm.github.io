NOTE : IT ONLY WORKS FOR IWR-8-28-18(Inworld Release 8/28/18) and later


But.... Down to business :

This month has brought many new things including : 

- A Mine
- Power Controller
- Electric Car and Charging Station
- Eating HUD
- And Several other things!


I am asking that if someone has a custom object they made for use with their farm, they send me a copy of it to put in our Farm Cooperative Region
